Man & Destiny:Some Reflections on Iqbals Concept of Khudi & the Perfect Man,"Man and Destiny:Some Reflections on Iqbals Concept of Khudi and the Perfect Man.

First Principles of Islamic Economics ,"Abul Ala Mawdudi (1903 - 79), one of the leading Muslim intellectuals of the twentieth century, laid down the foundations of modern Islamic economics. Drawing upon Islamic sources, Mawdudi spelled out major elements of a new paradigm for economic analysis and policy, wherein economic pursuits take place in the context of moral values and directed towards achievement of personal and social objectives. Integral to this approach is the concept of non-usury which attempts to make efficiency and equity inseparable and interdependent. In an Islamic framework creation and distribution of wealth become instrumental in promoting individual and social well-being, opening up pathways to development, social justice and human welfare. This comprehensive anthology is an essential introduction to Islamic Economics.  Khurshid Ahmad, who edited the Urdu original, Maashiyat-i-Islam, has contributed a substantial new Foreword to this authoritative English Translation by Shafaq Hashemi.  ""Islamic economics in a modern setting has developed reapidly over recent decades. At the very foundation of this is the work of Sayyid Abul Ala Mawdudi which is gathered together in this book. It establishes the major tenets of the economics of Islam from its original historical and religious sources.

Pioneers of Islamic Scholarship,"Over the fourteen centuries of its existence, Islamic scholarship has produced numerous individuals who have distinguished themselves by acquiring broad knowledge and deep insight. However, true distinction is only achieved through a lasting influence, particularly when the area of scholarship is a religion that presents itself as being suited to all communities at all times. The selection has to start with the founders of the eight schools of jurisprudence who have had a continuous following over the centuries up to the present day. This book introduces nine scholars from these schools and adds two more from a much later era whose influence extended far beyond the area of pure scholarship. In simple language, this book gives a clear picture of how the Islamic schools of jurisprudence differ in their methodologies, showing at the same time how much interaction they project. It serves as a primary source for those who wish to follow a course in Islamic studies, this book is indispensable for others who wish to have a fair but concise idea about the most important personalities who have shaped Islamic scholarship for centuries.",,Books->Children->Contemporary Fiction,10,5.95,5.95,5.95,0.38,,,,9.78086E+12,9780860375708.jpg,Paperback|Adil Salahi|2006|210|The Islamic Foundation,non-taxable,zero-rate

"British Secularism and Religion. Islam, Society and the State","British Secularism and Religion: Islam, Society and the State provides an in-depth deliberation upon the now unsettled relationship between religion and politics in twenty-first century Britain, with an emphasis upon Islam, the UKs second largest religion, which is now at the centre of the debate about the nature and future of British secularism. Combining theological reflections and academic and policy perspectives, this topical collection includes contributions from Ted Cantle, Sunder Katwala, Maleiha Malik, Tariq Modood, Abdullah Sahin, Norman Solomon and Nick Spencer.    'This interesting, topical and sometimes heated, conversation among theologians, social scientists and policy experts on British secularism helps to shed vital light on the challenges of accommodating religious minorities and majorities within modern societies. The contributors question a number of received assumptions about the public role of religion, and also challenge traditional Muslim suspicions of secularism, thus succeeding in moving the debate on Islam in Britain, and secular polities in general, to new and very promising ground. This is a vital contribution to ongoing topical debates on secularism, pluralism, inclusion and the direction modern societies should take'. - Dr. Abdelwahab El-Affendi, University of Westminster    'Religious voices in favour of secularism are often absent from the debate on religion and politics. But as a political attitude that will guarantee freedom of belief for all, secularism is relevant to all. This volume - though non-religious secularists may find much to challenge within it - is a welcome contribution to this most important of modern debates'. - Andrew Copson, Chief Executive, British Humanist Association",,Books->General,10,6.99,6.99,6.99,0.21,,,,9.78185E+12,9781847740151.jpg,"Paperback|Ataullah Siddiqui, Yahya Birt and Dilwar Hussain|2011|117|Kube Publishing ",non-taxable,zero-rate

Islam & Other Faiths ,"Collected in this volume are the late Ismail al-Faruqi's articles written over a span of two decades which deal with Islam and other faiths, Christianity and Judaism in particular. The book provides a good cross-section of al-Faruqi's contribution to the study of comparative religion and covers a wide spectrum of inter-religious issues, including commonality and differences between Islam, Christianity and Judaism, Muslim and non-Muslim relations, and the issue of Mission and Dawah. A fascinating study by an engaging and challenging activist-scholar of our time. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the relationship of Islam to other faiths has never been more important.

Wandering Lonely in a Crowd. Reflections on the Muslim Condition,"Wandering Lonely in a Crowd: Reflections on the Muslim Condition in the West is a timely collection of essays, articles, lectures and short stories that have been written during the Bush years, a time of political uncertainty for British Muslims after 2001. They cover the themes of integration, community cohesion, terrorism, radicalisation, cultural difference, multiculturalism, identity politics and liberalism. Imtiaz responds to the predicament of being a Muslim in modern Britain. Beginning with a raw and unedited response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and ending with Obamas election, these pieces cover the numerous facets of the debate that surrounds British Muslims today. The book sets out a narrative for these years and a response that argues that British Muslims should move away from identity politics towards Islamic humanism.  'S.M. Atif Imtiaz has worked in Equalities for the National Health Service, holds a doctorate in social psychology from the London School of Economics, and is a longstanding community activist.   ""Imtiaz is telling us to wake up to some tough global realities. Islam matters, more than anything else. Not just because it offers the most compelling and widely-followed alternative to turbo-capitalism, but because it does so on the basis of monotheism, historys most powerful idea. In these essays, spanning British and global Islamic issues of burning moment, Imtiaz reminds us that God has not gone away.""- Abdal Hakim Murad, Dean, Cambridge Muslim College.  ""From student radicalism in the nineties to Muslims at the centre of a national security policy in the 2000s, Atif Imtiazs generation has had to confront issues of identity, belonging, loyalty, commitment and their faith in much harsher, more polaraised terms than most. A careful thinker, drawing inspiration from many different sources including, of course, his Islamic faith, Imtiaz is one of those who is exploring and articulating what a twenty first Western expression of his religion might mean.""
